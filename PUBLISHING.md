1. Create New Repository

  Create a new GitHub repository:
  - Name: posthog-feature-flags (or similar)
  - Make it public so others can use the GitHub Action
  - Initialize with README, license (MIT recommended)

  2. Publishing Locations

  NPM Package

  - Registry: https://npmjs.com
  - Package name: posthog-feature-flags or @yourusername/posthog-feature-flags
  - Command: npm publish

  GitHub Action

  - Location: Same GitHub repository
  - Marketplace: Automatically listed in https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions
  - Usage: uses: yourusername/posthog-feature-flags@v1

  3. Repository Structure
